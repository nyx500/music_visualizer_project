Unfortunately, due to being unwell with COVID-19 at the beginning of June, I started my project quite late, but managed to catch up with quite a few visualizations in the last couple of weeks. 
The piano visualization may need a few tweaks because I would like the notes to correspond to the top frequencies a bit more, so perhaps I will change this part of the program to only display the notes lighted up for the higher part of the frequency spectrum and not for the drum part, and see how it works.
I have planned for most of my visualizations to take approximately one week, with the exception of the fractal trees visualization. I have planned for this to take me 2 to 3 weeks because both the theory and implementation of this visualization are extremely complex. 
I will have to experiment to see if my knowledge of recursive languages is proficient enough to implement this feature. If it proves to be too complex, I will instead focus on extending the Rain visualization to make my teardrop shapes 3 dimensional.
