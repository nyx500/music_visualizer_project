I chose the Music Visualizer template because it was close to my personal interests, as I am trained in Classical Guitar and piano. 
I also really enjoyed the Trigonometry sections of the Computational Mathematics module the most, I wanted to apply this fresh knowledge of geometry and polar coordinates in practice. Based on the extensions shown in the lectures, I adapted the Ridge Plots extension (Joy Division is one of my favourite bands), and to create a new visualization called “Mountains” using the noise() function. I also created a "Piano" visualization, where I mapped the frequencies in the FFT.analyze() array to the frequency for every key in the 7 octaves of a piano. Then I made a “Flowers” visualization that maps the height and size of 16 flowers to the averages of 16 frequency bands. Finally, I created two visualizations that adapt a circle representing different frequency volumes after being inspired by two YouTube videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O3nm0Nvbi4  and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk96O7N1Yo0. I would also like to implement a particle emitter visualization that represents the beats per minute in a music sample by changing the particles’ velocity.
